# DuetWifi configuration

This is my configuration for the DuetWifi on my HyperCube, which was built from a Wanhao i3, so the sizes are different than for the original HyperCube.

It's using a Titan Aero with a custom mount and the IR Probe by dc42.

## Configure slic3r

Temperatures are to be set in the configuration settings for the loaded
filament. So the temperature set in the slicer should not override the actual
setting. To achive this the `M104` line should not be generated by the slicer.
slic3r looks through the Start G-Code if it can find an `M104`. If it does, it
does not add the temperature command again. It does not check, if the line is
commented out.

Start G-code should look like this:

```
M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; set bed temperature with
;M104 S[first_layer_temperature]    ; set extruder temperature tool selection
M98 P/sys/before_print.g
````

Unfortunately the bed temperature cannot be configured in the firmware, so this
still needs to come from the slicer.

When the print is finished it is usually a good idea to turn off the heaters,
move the print head away from the object and power off the PSU. This can be done
by calling a macro like this:

```
M98 P/sys/after_print.g
```

This has the advantage that you still can print 'old' G-Code files even after
modifying the procedures you run after a print has finished.

Another thing that can be useful is setting the speed factor for small details
starting at a certain layer. This can be done with a simple 'After layer change
G-code':

```
M98 P/macros/Layerscripts/[filament_preset]/[layer_num]
```

This will display a warning message when the file is not found, which can be
ignored. `[filament_preset]` will be replaced by the name of the filament
profile in slic3r and `[layer_num]` by the number of the currently printing
layer.

For example, if you want to change the temperature of the bed after layer 10 you
can create a file in `/macros/Layerscripts/PETG/10` which contains the
corresponding commands to set the desired temperature.
